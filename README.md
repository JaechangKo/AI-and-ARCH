# AI and ARCH
 
### Architecture-in-the-Machine

This is the projects that I've worked on to have a lecture for AI presenting both opporunities and perils for the future of architecutre.
Today, architecture as a discipline finds itself in a moment of crisis and opportunity. The phrase "intelligent design"-not to be confused with the creationist-inspired, culture-warrior sense in which the term was used not so long ago! - has come to find direct relevance in the filed of architecutre - not in a theological way; no in a science curriculum way; but, rather, in a technological way. 

I'm focusing on design computing, which represents a broad set of topics that greatly extends the potential of computers in the design process beyond simple automation tasks. 
In order to explore the generative and creative potential of the computer, this course will unpack the “black box” of programming and scrutinize procedures and processes that can articulate formal systems. 
Hence, we will investigate a systematic design approach with the machine as collaborator, rather than a mere tool.

The world is increasingly written in algorithms. Engaging this reality requires designers to have the capacity to not only use available softwares, but to author new ones.
Open source thinking in software development allows users to modify or create specialized tools able to process or generate form within the framework of a pre-existing digital environment. 
Generative Design Computing gives students a framework to learn the rules and syntax of programming and then investigate the application and execution of algorithmic procedures in simple 
design projects. 
These algorithms will be authored and controlled primarily through Python, a high level, yet powerful programming language. 
The generative capacity of this language will be extended greatly through interfacing with the CAD software Rhino and the visual programming tool Grasshopper.
